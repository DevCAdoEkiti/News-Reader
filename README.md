# News Reader

News Reader is a news aggregator which is available for the Web and as a React Native app (Android / iOS) built for the Ado-Ekiti Facebook Developer Circle React meetup. This React runs on a web browser and, also, on both Android and iOS platforms.


From the same codebase you can render apps for the Web platform and natively for Android and iOS. Thanks to [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).

### Web
